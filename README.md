# hctsa_python

This is the beginnings of a python package for computing features of a time series using algorithms from across the scientific time-series analysis literature.

The current version is a template for such a package using partials, and is compatible with the [nitime](https://github.com/nipy/nitime) data format for time series.
The goal is for useful time-series algorithms to be ported across to native python implementations, for use in open source scientific applications (including those relating to signal processing in neuroscience).

The highly-developed *hctsa* Matlab repository is in Matlab form (email [Ben Fulcher](www.benfulcher.com) for an early copy), and has an associated website [here](www.comp-engine.org/timeseries).
